## Running trackers on test sequences
Every trackers comes with one sequence from OTB100. Simply run the function *run_tracker*.
If you would like to run a different sequence copy its folder into the sequences folder.
Then change the video name in the *run_tracker* function.


## Running trackers on OTB benchmark
Copy the trackers into the folder trackers of the benchmark.
Add the following to the *config_trackers* function.

```matlab
 trackersCA = {struct('name','MOSSE_CA','namePaper','MOSSE_CA'),...     
     struct('name','DCF_CA','namePaper','DCF_CA'),...   
     struct('name','SAMF_CA','namePaper','SAMF_CA'),...
     struct('name','STAPLE_CA','namePaper','STAPLE_CA')};

trackers = trackersCA;
```
